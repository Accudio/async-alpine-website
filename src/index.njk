	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>Async Alpine is a wrapper around the Alpine.js JavaScript framework that allows you to load components asyncronously on-demand.</p>
	<p>Alpine.js is a fantastic framework but with a large site with lots of components, the bundle size can start to become a performance problem!</p>
	<p>Async Alpine allows you to split your components into multiple component files and only load them when they're needed, speeding up your first load!</p>
