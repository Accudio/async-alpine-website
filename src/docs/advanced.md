# Advanced

## Delayed Initialisation {id=delayed-init}

Although the primary purpose of Async Alpine is to load JavaScript component modules, it could be useful to use it's capabilities for delayed initialisation of Alpine components or elements within a component. When an element doesn't have a download function declared via one of the [download methods](/docs/usage/), Async Alpine will simply remove the `x-ignore` attribute when the loading strategy is met. This means you can use it with an empty or inline `x-data` component, or even any element within an Alpine component, like the following:

```html
<!-- delaying the initialisation of a component
with inline x-data until it's visible -->
<div
  ax-load="visible"
  x-data="{
    message: 'loaded'
  }"
  x-ignore
  x-html="message"
></div>

<!-- delaying the initialisation of an element within
a normal alpine component until it's visible -->
<div x-data>
  <div
    ax-load="visible"
    x-ignore
    x-html="'loaded'"
  ></div>
</div>
```

## Advanced Options {id=options}

Advanced options are provided as an optional second parameter to `AsyncAlpine.init()` as an object. As an example here we set Alpine and Async Alpine to use prefixes starting with `data-` for HTML spec compliance:

```js
AsyncAlpine.init(Alpine, {
  prefix: 'data-ax-',
  alpinePrefix: 'data-x-'
})
Alpine.prefix('data-x-')
```

For a script installation, advanced options can be specified by setting `window.AsyncAlpineOptions` to the object as above.

### Available Options

| Option Name          | property          | Default | Notes |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Custom Prefix        | `prefix`          | `ax-`   | Sets the prefix Async Alpine uses for attributes. Can be set to `data-ax-` to make markup HTML spec-compliant. Similar to `alpinePrefix` below. |
| Custom Alpine Prefix | `alpinePrefix`    | `x-`    | If you set a [custom prefixes](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/discussions/2042#discussioncomment-1304957) for Alpine.js, set this here also |
| Default Strategy     | `defaultStrategy` | `eager` | Allows changing the strategy used when the `ax-load` attribute is empty. |
