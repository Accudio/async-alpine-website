# Credits and Contributing

Async Alpine wouldn't be possible without the help of lots of people, so here's to them! If you want to help out and become one of those people then please do!

## Credits

Async Alpine is primary built and maintained by [Alistair Shepherd](https://alistairshepherd.uk) ([@accudio](https://twitter.com/accudio)).

A big thank you to [those who have contributed code](#contributors), anyone who has found bugs and filed issues, or tried it out and given us feedback!

[Series Eight](https://serieseight.com) supports and funds much of my work on Async Alpine, and whose projects provide a great proving ground for previous and experimental versions!
