# Credits and Contributing

Async Alpine wouldn't be possible without the help of lots of people, so here's to them! If you want to help out and become one of those people then please do!

## Credits

Async Alpine is primary built and maintained by [Alistair Shepherd](https://alistairshepherd.uk) ([@accudio](https://twitter.com/accudio)).

A big thank you to anyone who has found bugs and files issues, or tried it out and given us feedback!

A thank you also to [Series Eight](https://serieseight.com) whose projects provided a great proving ground for the initial production tests of Async Alpine.

## Contributing

If you have any feedback please get in touch! If you've found a bug or have a feature request the best place is in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/accudio/async-alpine/issues). There are also [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Accudio/async-alpine/discussions) if it's something less formal or you just have a question, and if it's more personal you can DM [@accudio](https://twitter.com/accudio) on twitter.
